# Convolutional Neural Network:
   - Form of Neural Network
   - Uses three-dimensional data for image classification and
     object recognition tasks
   - Computationally expensive-- requires GPU for training
   - Three main types of layers:
      - Convolutional layer
      - Pooling layer
      - Fully-Connected layer

# Convolutional Layer:
   - Input (in our case, a color image)
      - 3 dimensions corresponding to RGB
   - Feature detector (AKA Kernel/Filter)
      - 2D array of weights
      - Represents part of the image
      - Filter size typically = 3x3 matrix
      - Applied to an area of the image
      - Dot product is calculated between input pixels and 
        filter and fed into an output away
      - Filter shifts by a stride, repeating until kernel
        sweeps across entire input
   - Feature Map
      - Final output from series of dot products from input and
        filter

# Pooling Layer:
   - Also known as downsampling
   - Dimensionality reduction, reducing number of input parameters
   - Also sweeps a filter across entire input, but the filter has 
     no weights
   - Applies aggregation function to values within field
   - Two types:
      - Max (selects pixel with max value in the filter)
      - Average (selects average value in receptive field to send
        to output array)
   - Info is lost but pooling layers reduce complexity, improve 
     efficiency, and reduce overfitting

# Fully-Connected Layer:
   - Each node in output layer directly connects to a node in the
     previous layer
   - Performs classification based on features extracted through
     previous layers
   - Convolutional/pooling tend to use ReLU activation function,
     while FC tends to use softmax to classify inputs
     appropriately, with a confidence score 0-1
